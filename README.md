This is a presentation about "DATA PREPARATION WITH PANDAS"

Data preparation is the first step after you get your hands on any kind of dataset. 
This is the step when you pre-process raw data into a form that can be easily and accurately analyzed. 
Proper data preparation allows for efficient analysis - it can eliminate errors and inaccuracies that could have occurred during the data gathering process and can thus help in removing some bias resulting from poor data quality. 
Therefore a lot of an analyst's time is spent on this vital step.
